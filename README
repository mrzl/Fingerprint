Fingerprint.\n

I have always been impressed by the fact that every fingerprint of every person is slightly different. And since I'm a big fan of patterns in general I liked the abstract way of what a fingerprint is actually like. I wanted to have a little closer look and found a way to digitalize my fingerprint and put it in the physical world, so you can touch and feel it more detailed. Since the technology is there and an Shapeways order is just 3 clicks and 3 weeks away, I did it.
