in order to skip the staging area and commit every file that has been changed since the last commit use the command:
commit -a (-m "message")

if you want to remove a file from the directory and remove it from being tracked by git use the command
git rm filename

if you want to just remove it from being tracked, but still present on the harddrive use
git rm --cached filename

this displays a pretty log of the commits
git log --pretty=shirt --graph

mit dem folgenden programm hat man eine noch bessere grafische darstellung der commit historie
gitk
